## MNIST-App
I've trained a model, you can access the model training in MNIST-Pytorch.ipynb file. Visualisation of the weights has been set up according the model. 
Interactive app for predicting the digits from 0-9. One can interact with canvas to draw their own numbers from 0-9. From the displayed number, model will predict the input.
The predicted output will be displayed on the app. The app shows real time update.
