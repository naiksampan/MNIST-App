# Handwritten Digit Classification with MNIST and PyTorch

This repository demonstrates a complete pipeline for training a deep learning model to classify handwritten digits from 0 to 9 using the MNIST dataset. The project includes model training, weight visualization, and an interactive web application for real-time digit prediction.

## Features

- **Model Training**: The `MNIST-Pytorch.ipynb` file contains the training pipeline for a neural network model using PyTorch. This notebook includes data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation.
  
- **Weight Visualization**: Visualizations of the trained model's weights have been included to provide insights into its learning process.

- **Interactive Prediction App**: An interactive web application has been developed that allows users to:
  - Draw digits (0–9) on a canvas in real time.
  - Display the drawn digit on the app interface.
  - Predict the drawn digit using the trained model.
  - View real-time updates of predictions.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Streamlit (for running the app)
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mnist-digit-classifier.git
   cd mnist-digit-classifier
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Train the Model** (Optional):
   - Open and execute the `MNIST-Pytorch.ipynb` notebook to train the model or review the training process.
   - A pre-trained model is included in the repository for quick usage.

4. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   - The app will open in your default browser. Draw a digit on the canvas to see real-time predictions.
